   distributing an encrypted message and deciding which of the various teams was able to decipher the message accurately (winner of the competition).
   
  -Allies, Decoding teams of the allies competing among themselves to be the first to succeed in deciphering the encrypted message transmitted by the UBoat.
  
  -Agent, Agents who are members of the various decoding teams and are responsible for performing the decoding tasks themselves.
   Each agent is a member of exactly one team.
   
  -Battlefield, The battlefield where the competition takes place. Battleground settings include the name,
   how many decryption teams are participating in each competition, and the difficulty level of the decryption.
   Each battle involves exactly one German submarine, and one or more decoding team.
